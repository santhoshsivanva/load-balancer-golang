In computing, load balancing is the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing more efficient. 
Load balancing can optimize the response time and avoid unevenly overloading some compute nodes while other compute nodes are left idle.

# Lets build a load balancer 

- HTTP server (5)
- Loadbalancer:
        * Round robin (using this algorithm)

- Health check process
